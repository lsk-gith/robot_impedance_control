%RPY2JAC Jacobian from RPY angle rates to angular velocity
%
% J = RPY2JAC(RPY, OPTIONS) is a Jacobian matrix (3x3) that maps ZYX roll-pitch-yaw angle 
% rates to angular velocity at the operating point RPY=[R,P,Y].
%
% J = RPY2JAC(R, P, Y, OPTIONS) as above but the roll-pitch-yaw angles are passed
% as separate arguments.
%
% Options::
% 'xyz'     Use XYZ roll-pitch-yaw angles
% 'yxz'     Use YXZ roll-pitch-yaw angles
%
% Notes::
% - Used in the creation of an analytical Jacobian.
%
% See also EUL2JAC, SerialLink.JACOBE.
